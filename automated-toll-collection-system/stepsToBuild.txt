Components Required :
----------------------

1)	ESP8266 v1.0 w/ FTDI
2) 	EM-18 RFID READER
3)	13.56Mhz Tags
4)	Misc Components 

DEVICE BUILD
-------------

Step 1: Setting up the IDE to Program the ESP8266

Installing the Arduino ESP8266 Core with the Boards Manager

    -	Download and Install Arduino 1.6.6 from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software]
    -	Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
    -	Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. 
    -	You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
    -	Open Boards Manager from Tools > Boards > Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don't forget to select your 
    	ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).

Uploading the Program to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE

Step 1: Get this Git Repo to your desktop using,

            git clone 

Step 2: Open the codes in Arduino IDE

Step 3: Select the NodeMCU 1.0(ESP8266 V12-E), 80Mhz,115200

Step 4: Select the USB Port from Tools - > Port

Step 5: Edit the SSID and PASSWORD to configure to your router

Step 6: Edit the pubnub publish and subscribe keys to your unique key provided by pubnub.com

Step 7: Upload the Code to the ESP8266 

(Note: Connect the GPIO 0 to GND to Pull the ESP8266 to Flashing Mode)

MOBILE APP BUILD
-----------------
Steps to be followed to Build and Run the Android App for Smart Toll Collection System
(Note : Assumed Cordova framework & android SDK is installed in your system)
(Note : For a pre-compiled app follow step 4)

Step 1 : Change the cordova project directory 

            cd (folder_name)

Step 2 : Modify the pubnub publish and subscribe keys at www/js/index.js

Step 3 : Build the .apk file using,

            cordova build android

Step 4 : Once the .apk file is build successfully, you will find the app at this path

            ./platforms/android/build/output/android-debug.apk

Step 5 : Install the App on an Android Phone.
