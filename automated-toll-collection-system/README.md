Smart Toll Plaza  System using RFID is an enhancement  to the currently deployed manual toll collection system. Time and efficiency are a matter of priority in present days. To over come the major problem of traffic congestion at toll plaza during peak hours , this RF Id based smart toll collection system makes toll transaction more convenient for travellers.  Considering the present toll collection system , where all vehicles have to stop and pay taxes. On an average each vehicle passing through a toll plaza has to wait approx. 2 minute in a toll at engine start condition which thereby aids in air pollution and wastage of fuel & money. If this system comes to existence, the waiting time at toll plaza will be reduced.

In this project, an RF Id card in the vehicle will be scanned by the reader placed at the toll plaza to automate the toll collection and billing for the user. This system also supports a mobile app for notifying the user about the toll transaction. Further, this app can also assist the  user to check their historical toll transactions, & manage money recharge. This system has a unique feature whereby the system can report a stolen vehicle if the vehicleâ€™s owner blocks it.
